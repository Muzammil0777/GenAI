# GenAI Model Tokenization and Generation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates tokenization, model configuration, and generation tasks using the `transformers` library. The model used is `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`. This notebook walks through downloading model shards, initializing a tokenizer, and validating configurations for generating text based on user input.

### Key Features
- **Model Tokenization**: Uses `AutoTokenizer` to tokenize text inputs for the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1` model.
- **Model Shard Handling**: Demonstrates how to download large model weight shards (`.safetensors`) and load them for use.
- **Generation Configuration**: Configures various generation parameters, including stopping criteria, temperature, and padding settings.
- **Validation of Model Inputs**: Ensures proper usage of input arguments and flags any unused or incorrectly set arguments.

### What This Notebook Does
1. **Model Initialization**:
   - Downloads the model weights in shard form to manage memory efficiently.
   - Sets up the `AutoTokenizer` to tokenize text inputs in a way that suits the model.
   
2. **Tokenization Process**:
   - Tokenizes text sequences with the tokenizer's padding set to the left, ensuring compatibility with the model's requirements.
   - Prepares the model for text generation by transforming raw text into token IDs.

3. **Generation Configuration**:
   - Configures text generation parameters such as temperature, stopping criteria, and other parameters to control the quality and behavior of generated text.
   - Validates the configuration and ensures all required parameters are set correctly.
   
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates the model's input arguments (`model_kwargs`) and raises errors for any unused or incorrectly set parameters, providing insight into common mistakes and typos in generation arguments.

5. **Text Generation**:
   - After configuring and validating the model, the notebook can be used to generate text from the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1` model using custom inputs and generation settings.

### Usage
This notebook is useful for:
- Tokenizing text inputs using the `Mistral-7B` model.
- Downloading and handling large model shards efficiently.
- Configuring and validating text generation parameters such as temperature, stopping criteria, and more.
- Generating text based on user-defined inputs and configurations.
