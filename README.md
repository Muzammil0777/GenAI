## Introduction

The **GenAI** project provides an easy-to-use, customizable generative model designed for applications such as text generation, language modeling, and conversational AI. It builds upon popular AI architectures and fine-tuning techniques to generate coherent and meaningful text outputs based on given prompts.

## Features

- Fine-tuned Transformer-based generative model.
- Customizable prompts and outputs.
- Easy integration with Hugging Face's model hub.
- Supports generation of text in various styles and tones.
- Can be used for chatbots, text completion, story generation, and more.

## Installation

To get started with **GenAI**, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muzammil0777/GenAI.git
cd GenAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the necessary libraries, including `transformers` and `torch`, installed.

## Usage

You can use **GenAI** to generate text based on custom inputs. Here's an example of how to run the model:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha")

# Generate text from a custom prompt
prompt = "Once upon a time in a faraway land"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)

# Print generated text
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

You can modify the model, tokenizer, and input prompt to generate texts based on your desired style.

## Model Training

If you'd like to train or fine-tune **GenAI** on your own data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in a format compatible with Hugging Face Datasets.
2. Fine-tune the model using the following script:

```bash
python train.py --model HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha --data_path <your_dataset> --output_dir <output_directory>
```

3. Adjust training parameters (batch size, learning rate, etc.) within the `train.py` script to suit your hardware capabilities.
